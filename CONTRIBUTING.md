## 🔧 Development Guidelines

### Code Standards

**Python Code:**
```python
# Use type hints
def analyze_traffic(packets: List[Dict]) -> SecurityReport:
    """Analyze network traffic for security anomalies.
    
    Args:
        packets: List of network packet dictionaries
        
    Returns:
        SecurityReport object with analysis results
    """
    pass

# Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
# Use docstrings for all functions and classes
# Include error handling and logging
```

**PowerShell Scripts:**
```powershell
# Use approved verbs and proper formatting
function Set-ICSSecurityPolicy {
    [CmdletBinding()]
    param(
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
        [string]$PolicyName,
        
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
        [hashtable]$Settings
    )
    
    # Include error handling
    try {
        # Implementation
    }
    catch {
        Write-Error "Failed to set security policy: $_"
    }
}
```

**Bash Scripts:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Use strict mode
set -euo pipefail

# Include function documentation
# @description: Hardens Linux ICS system
# @param $1: Configuration file path
# @return: 0 on success, 1 on failure
harden_ics_system() {
    local config_file="$1"
    
    # Implementation with error handling
    if [[ ! -f "$config_file" ]]; then
        echo "Error: Configuration file not found" >&2
        return 1
    fi
}
```

### Security Considerations

- **No Hardcoded Credentials**: Never include passwords, API keys, or certificates
- **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs and external data
- **Secure Defaults**: Implement secure-by-default configurations
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling without information disclosure
- **Logging**: Include appropriate security logging and audit trails

### Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: All functions must have unit tests
- **Integration Tests**: Test tool interactions and workflows
- **Security Tests**: Validate security control effectiveness
- **Documentation Tests**: Ensure examples work as documented

## 📋 Submission Process

### 1. Issue Creation

Before starting work, create an issue to discuss:
- Problem description or enhancement proposal
- Proposed solution approach
- Implementation timeline
- Any breaking changes

### 2. Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names:
- `feature/network-segmentation-tool`
- `bugfix/windows-hardening-script`
- `docs/compliance-guide-update`
- `security/vulnerability-scanner-fix`

### 3. Commit Messages

Follow conventional commit format:
```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Examples:
- `feat(network): add Modbus TCP security analyzer`
- `fix(hardening): resolve Windows registry permission issue`
- `docs(framework): update Purdue model architecture`
- `security(scanner): patch SQL injection vulnerability`

### 4. Pull Request Process

1. **Create PR** with clear title and description

### API Documentation
```python
def scan_network(target_range: str, protocols: List[str]) -> ScanResult:
    """Scan network range for ICS devices and protocols.
    
    This function performs active scanning of the specified network range
    to identify ICS devices and supported protocols. Use with caution in
    production environments.
    
    Args:
        target_range: Network range in CIDR notation (e.g., "192.168.1.0/24")
        protocols: List of protocols to scan for (e.g., ["modbus", "dnp3"])
        
    Returns:
        ScanResult object containing discovered devices and their protocols
        
    Raises:
        NetworkError: If network is unreachable
        PermissionError: If insufficient privileges for scanning
        
    Example:
        >>> result = scan_network("192.168.1.0/24", ["modbus", "dnp3"])
        >>> print(f"Found {len(result.devices)} devices")
        Found 5 devices
    """
```
