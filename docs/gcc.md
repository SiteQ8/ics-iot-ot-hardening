## Identified Gap

No publicly accessible, GCC-wide or other member-state–specific IoT/ICS/OT cybersecurity guidelines beyond the above were found. Organizations should adopt international standards (e.g., NIST SP 800-82, IEC 62443) and coordinate with national CERTs for detailed OT/ICS requirements.
