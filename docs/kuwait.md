# Kuwait IoT/ICS/OT Cybersecurity References

This document compiles publicly available resources and frameworks relevant to securing Industrial Control Systems (ICS), Operational Technology (OT), and Internet of Things (IoT) deployments in Kuwait. Where no Kuwait-specific guidance exists, this is noted as a gap.

## Central Bank of Kuwait (CBK)

- **CBK Announcement: Introduction of Cyber Security Framework**  
  Press release detailing the launch of the CBK Cyber Security Framework.

## National Cybersecurity Strategy

- **National Cyber Security Strategy of the State of Kuwait**  
  Overarching national strategy covering critical infrastructure protection, which may include OT/ICS considerations.

## Identified Gap

No dedicated Kuwait-specific guidelines for **IoT**, **ICS**, or **OT** cybersecurity have been published.  
Organizations should adopt and tailor international standards (e.g., NIST SP 800-82, IEC 62443) to meet local regulatory requirements.
